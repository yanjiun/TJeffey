Information we need to store for prototype:
(Congressional race)

Candidate Info:
(schema flexibility gives us leeway to store incumbents and challengers slightly differently, since challengers may not have any public voting records)
- state
- district
- zip code
- name
- party
- current congress member?
- term? (only for the current congress members)
- chamber for election
// these would be manually curated at first then data driven 
// with voting records or press/news stories
- projected answer to each question (Y/N answers)
- weights to each question (integer scale)
- picture id (array of pictures stored separately):::

User Info:
- answers to each question (Y/N answers)
- weights to each question (integer scale)
- uri to link to their results
- zipcode
- match results (this should be stored for fast retrieval on return?)

Topic Info:
- Category
- Question

Design decisions and considerations:
- Which data to embed data, which data to reference
- Reference less used data or data that requires heavy storage to save memory
- Think about which "questions" do we have. What queries do we want to use?
- Documents have 16MB size limit
